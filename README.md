Definition of infinite list and take function of Haskell using Python

This are just-for-fun functions that simulate what I think is a beautiful feature in Haskell, infinite lists. In Python I've simulate them with a generator which can go through infinity.
To complete the job I've also created the take function that takes the first n elements of a iterator.

The reason I've done this...as I've written before, just for fun. A friend of mine tell me a little riddle and as a computer scientist I wanted a computer to find the solution for me.

If you want to try the riddle is about system modulo equation:
"A girl need to count some eggs but:
 if she counts 2 to 2, only one is left, but also
 if she counts 3 to 3, only one is left. The same
 happen if she counts 4 by 4, 5 by 5 and 6 by 6.
 Only if she counts 7 by 7, none is left.
 How many eggs does the girl have?"
